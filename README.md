# Arduino Uno Servo Motor Control

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an Arduino Uno. The servo motor sweeps back and forth between 0 to 180 degrees, showcasing basic servo motor control capabilities.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Servo Motor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Servo Motor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal wire of the servo motor to digital pin 9 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the power (VCC) and ground (GND) of the servo motor to the respective power and ground pins on the Arduino Uno or an external power supply.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the servo motor to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the servo motor sweeping smoothly from 0 to 180 degrees and back.

#### Applications

- **Mechanical Control:** Use for controlling physical mechanisms such as robotic arms or camera mounts.
- **Automation:** Integrate with sensors for automated positioning based on environmental conditions.
- **Educational Projects:** Learn about servo motor operation and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control.

#### Notes

- Ensure the servo motor is powered adequately to handle its load and movement range.
- Adjust the servo motor connections and code parameters for different ranges or specific angles as required.
- Explore advanced servo motor functionalities such as continuous rotation servos or feedback-controlled servos for more sophisticated projects.
